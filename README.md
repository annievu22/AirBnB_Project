## ✨ 5. Features / Highlights

### • Business Problem

With over 100,000 Airbnb listings in NYC alone, users and hosts alike struggle to understand how room type, neighborhood, and seasonality affect pricing and performance. Business users also need to spot underserved regions or property types to optimize offerings.

> **Key questions** included:  
> - Where are listings concentrated?  
> - How does pricing vary by room type and borough?  
> - What time periods have higher user engagement?

- Enables users to explore trends in Airbnb listings across New York City
- Supports data-driven decisions in pricing strategy, marketing, and host targeting
- Helps uncover patterns in neighborhood performance and review volume

## ✅ 11. Final Conclusion

This project illustrates the power of combining data analytics and interactive visualization to derive meaningful insights from large-scale marketplace data. By cleaning and analyzing over 100,000 Airbnb listings in New York City, I was able to uncover valuable trends in pricing, room types, and geographic distribution that directly inform platform strategy and host decision-making.

Through Python, I built a structured pipeline for data preparation, ensuring accuracy and completeness. Tableau enabled me to transform raw data into a dynamic dashboard that supports real-time exploration, helping users compare boroughs, track seasonal changes, and understand host behavior patterns.

The insights gained can support Airbnb in multiple areas—from optimizing pricing algorithms to targeting underserved neighborhoods. This project not only demonstrates my ability to work with real-world messy data but also shows how to communicate findings effectively through data storytelling.

In the future, this dashboard could be enhanced by:
- Incorporating **time-based filters** to observe trends year-over-year
- Adding **sentiment analysis** from reviews to complement quantitative data
- Connecting **external datasets** such as tourism rates or COVID-19 restrictions for richer context

Overall, the Airbnb Data Analytics Project exemplifies how analytical thinking, technical tools, and visualization techniques can come together to support data-driven decisions in platform-based business models.
